## Background: LF Federated Execution

A Tag is basically like a logical time, so it makes sense to add a logical delay to a Tag.

Throughout, $e_1$ and $e_2$ will denote events occurring in a process called the RTI. Every event involves the RTI either sending a message to a federate, or receiving a message from a federate. So, if Federate($e_1$) = f, then that means that $e_1$ is an event in which the RTI either sends a message to f or receives a message from f.

Federates have ports. Different federates are connected to each other via their ports, possibly using multiple connections, and every connection has a nonnegative logical delay associated with it. If a connection goes from federate $A$ to federate $B$, and the delay associated with that connection is $D$, then that means that when federate A is executing some tag $T$, it is possible for federate A to send a signal that logically reaches federate B at tag $T' := T + D$.

The RTI ensures that if a federate A sends a signal to a federate B that logically reaches federate B at time $T'$, federate B will not execute anything at a tag later than $T'$ before it receives the signal. Furthermore, before federate B receives the signal, federate B can only execute things at the tag $T'$ that are statically guaranteed not to be affected by the signal. When federate B violates these rules by executing something too early, we call that an STP (safe-to-process) violation.

In addition to preventing STP violations, the RTI must prevent deadlocks by allowing federates to proceed forward to logical times when they may have events to process.

The RTI can be described as receiving information from federates, possibly aggregating it into information about the current state of the system, and then propagating the information in such a way that federates can proceed without STP violations.

To ensure that messages arrive in the right order, even messages that conceptually should go from federate to federate go through the RTI. For example, PORT_ABS and TAGGED_MSG messages are sent from an upstream federate to the RTI, and then from the RTI to the downstream federate. However, most messages simply go from a federate to the RTI or from the RTI to a federate, and do not directly correspond to any federate-to-federate communication. For example, federates do not send TAG or PTAG messages; instead, they only receive such messages from the RTI, because it is up to the RTI, not the federates, to control federates' time advancement.

The RTI also coordinates program initialization and shutdown.

A given message is of one of the following types:

1. FED_ID (Federate ID): This is sent from a federate to the RTI during program initialization so that the federate can declare its ID to the RTI.
2. ACK (ACKnowledgement): This message acknowledges receipt of a federate ID.
3. TIMESTAMP: This message is used during initialization to help the federates and the RTI agree on a start time for the main part of the program.
4. NET (Next Event Tag): This message is sent from a federate to the RTI to declare the time of the next event that has been scheduled to occur at that federate so far.
5. PORT_ABS (PORT ABSent): This message communicates that an upstream federate is not going to send a signal that will be received at a particular port of a downstream federate at a particular tag. The federate associated with a PORT_ABS message that the RTI receives is the upstream federate, because that is the federate that the RTI is communicating with; and the federate associated with a PORT_ABS message that the RTI sends is the downstream federate, because then the RTI is communicating to the downstream federate. However, the tag associated with a PORT_ABS message always corresponds to a (logical) tag from the perspective of the downstream federate, both when that message is received by the RTI and when it is forwarded from the RTI to the downstream federate.
6. PTAG (Provisional Tag Advance Grant): This message is sent from the RTI to a federate to communicate that the federate is allowed to proceed forward in logical time up to but not including a particular tag.
7. TAGGED_MSG (Tagged MeSsaGe): This is a signal that goes from a federate to another federate via some connection. The only difference between a TAGGED_MSG and a PORT_ABS message is that a TAGGED_MSG indicates presence of a signal on the connection instead of absence; however, otherwise is very similar to a PORT_ABS message. In particular, just like with a PORT_ABS message, the federate associated with a TAGGED_MSG depends on whether the message is being received or sent by the RTI, whereas its associated tag always corresponds to a (logical) tag from the perspective of the downstream federate.
8. TAG (Tag Advance Grant): This message is sent from the RTI to a federate to communicate that the federate is allowed to proceed forward in logical time up to and including a particular tag.
9. STOP_REQ (STOP REQuest)
10. STOP_REQ_REP (STOP REQuest REPly)
11. STOP_GRN (STOP GRaNted)
12. LTC (Logical Tag Complete): This message is sent from a federate to the RTI to declare that the federate is finished executing a particular tag.

TAGGED_MSG messages that are received from an upstream federate while the upstream federate is executing a tag $T$ are associated with the tag $T + D$ when a federate-to-federate signal on a connection will be received. PORT_ABS messages are similar.

## Preliminary Syntax Explanation

`e_1 ≺ e_2` means that it is not possible, under any physical, real-life execution of the federated program, for `e_1` to occur after `e_2` in physical time.

Formulas are stated in an S-expression-like format. For example, where we write `(f e_1)`, we mean "f of $e_1$".

All events are described from the perspective of the RTI. For example, where we write `(e_1 is (Receiving PORT_ABS))`, we mean that $e_1$ is an event in which a federate sends a PORT_ABS message, and the RTI receives the PORT_ABS message. Similarly, where we write `((e_1 is (Sending PORT_ABS)))`, we mean that `e_1` is an event in which the RTI is sends a PORT_ABS message, and a federate receives the PORT_ABS message.

## Formula 1

Formula 1 states:

```
((((e1 is (Receiving LTC))) ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2)) ∧ ((Tag e1) <
(Tag e2)))

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then build up to larger sub-formulas.

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - `(e_1 is (Receiving LTC))`: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message.
   - `(Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2))`: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - `((Tag e_1) < (Tag e_2))`: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of event $e_2`.
   - `(e_2 is (Receiving LTC))`: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving a Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - `((e_1 is (Receiving LTC)) ∧ (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) < (Tag e_2)))`: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of $e_2`.
   - `((e_1 is (Receiving LTC)) ∧ (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) < (Tag e_2))) ∧ (e_2 is (Receiving LTC))`: This sub-formula is true when the above conditions hold for event $e_1$ and event $e_2`.

3. Conclusion:
   - The antecedent of the implication is true when the larger sub-formula `((e_1 is (Receiving LTC)) ∧ (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) < (Tag e_2))) ∧ (e_2 is (Receiving LTC))` is true. This means that event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of $e_2`, and event $e_2$ also involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.

By analyzing the truth conditions of the sub-formulas, we can understand when the antecedent of the implication is true based on the events $e_1$ and $e_2` in the context of the RTI and LTC messages.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 1

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves receiving a Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message, and event $e_2$ in the same federate also involves receiving an LTC message, and the federate associated with both events is the same, and the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of event $e_2$, then it is not possible for event $e_1$ to occur after event $e_2$ in physical time.

In simpler terms, the formula ensures that if the RTI receives an LTC message at an earlier logical time than another LTC message received by the same federate, then the first LTC message cannot occur after the second LTC message in physical time. This condition helps maintain the logical ordering of events within the federate to prevent inconsistencies or violations of the logical time progression.

The formula guarantees this relationship for all possible events $e_1$ and $e_2$, ensuring that the logical time constraints imposed by the LTC messages are upheld consistently throughout the execution of the federated program.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

The guarantee is expected to be correct because the RTI and federates operate under a strict logical time system to ensure the correct sequence of events. When a federate sends an LTC message to the RTI, it indicates that the federate has completed all activities up to a certain logical tag. Since logical time progresses linearly and cannot move backwards, if a federate sends an LTC for a lower logical tag followed by an LTC for a higher logical tag, these messages must be processed by the RTI in the order they were sent to maintain the integrity of the logical timeline. The RTI's role in coordinating federate activities based on logical time ensures that messages reflecting earlier logical times are processed before those of later logical times, aligning with the real-world sequence of events and preventing any violations of the logical time progression.

  ∧ ((((e2 is (Sending TAG))) ∨ ((e2 is (Sending PTAG))))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then build up to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $((e_1$ is (Sending STOP_GRN)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a STOP_GRN message.
   - $((e_1$ is (Receiving LTC)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.
   - $(((e_1$ is (Receiving NET)) ∨ ((e_1$ is (Sending TAGGED_MSG))))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI either receiving a NET message or sending a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - $((Tag e_1) = (Tag e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tags of events $e_1$ and $e_2$ are equal.
   - $(((Tag e_1)$ finite) ∧ $((Tag e_1) ≠ 0))$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is a finite value and not equal to 0.
   - $((e_2$ is (Sending TAG)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending a TAG message.
   - $((e_2$ is (Sending PTAG)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending a PTAG message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - $((e_1$ is the first event satisfying (...))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ is the first event satisfying the conditions specified within the parentheses.
   - $(((e_1$ is the first event satisfying (...)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) = (Tag e_2)) ∧ (((Tag e_1)$ finite) ∧ $((Tag e_1) ≠ 0)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ is the first event satisfying the specified conditions, and the logical tags of $e_1$ and $e_2$ are equal and $Tag e_1$ is a finite value not equal to 0.
   - $(((e_2$ is (Sending TAG)) ∨ $((e_2$ is (Sending PTAG))))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending either a TAG or a PTAG message.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - $(((e_1$ is the first event satisfying (...)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) = (Tag e_2)) ∧ (((Tag e_1)$ finite) ∧ $((Tag e_1) ≠ 0))) ∧ (((e_2$ is (Sending TAG)) ∨ $((e_2$ is (Sending PTAG))))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies the specified conditions, the logical tags of $e_1$ and $e_2$ are equal, $Tag e_1$ is a finite value not equal to 0, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending either a TAG or a PTAG message.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas and analyzing when each sub-formula is true, we can understand the conditions under which the entire antecedent holds true, leading to the implication $e_1 ≺ e_2$.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 2

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI is the first event satisfying certain conditions involving the sending of a STOP_GRN message, receiving an LTC message, receiving a NET message, or sending a TAGGED_MSG message, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is equal to the logical tag of event $e_2$ (which is a finite non-zero value), and event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending either a TAG or a PTAG message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. This formula ensures that when specific events related to message exchanges and logical tags occur in the RTI, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct progression of events in the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

The guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the principles governing the logical time progression and message handling within a federated system. The RTI, as the coordinator of logical time and message exchange among federates, must ensure that messages are processed in a sequence that respects the logical time constraints. Specifically, before the RTI can send a TAG (Tag Advance Grant) or PTAG (Provisional Tag Advance Grant) message to a federate, allowing it to advance to or perform actions at a new logical time, it must first process any relevant messages (such as STOP_GRN, LTC, NET, or TAGGED_MSG) that pertain to the current or earlier logical times. This ordering ensures that all necessary conditions are met and that federates only proceed when it is safe to do so, maintaining the integrity of the simulation's logical timeline and preventing any logical time violations.

## Formula 3

Formula 3 states:

```
(((((e1 is (Receiving PORT_ABS))) ∨ ((e1 is (Receiving TAGGED_MSG))))
    ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2))
    ∧ ((Tag e1) ≤ (Tag e2)))
  ∧ (((e2 is (Receiving LTC)))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining each atomic sub-formula and then build up to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is receiving PORT_ABS: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS message.
   - $e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when events $e_1$ and $e_2$ occur in the same federate.
   - Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is receiving LTC: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:
   - $((e_1$ is receiving PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving either a PORT_ABS or a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - $(((e_1$ is receiving PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions of receiving either a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, and having a logical tag less than or equal to that of event $e_2.
   - $(((e_1$ is receiving PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)) ∧ ($e_2$ is receiving LTC): This sub-formula is true when the previous conditions are met for event $e_1$, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.

Therefore, the antecedent of the implication is true when event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions of receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, having a logical tag less than or equal to that of event $e_2, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.

_(This explanation was generated in 11 seconds.)_

### Summary of the meaning of formula 3

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message from a federate, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, with the logical tag of $e_1$ being less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. This formula ensures that when the RTI receives certain types of messages from a federate and then subsequently receives an LTC message, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct progression of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 3 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it adheres to the fundamental principle of logical time progression within a federated simulation system. When a federate sends a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG to the RTI, it signifies a communication regarding the absence or presence of a signal at a specific logical time. The subsequent sending of an LTC message by the same federate, which the RTI receives, indicates that the federate has completed all processing up to a certain logical tag. For the system to maintain a coherent and consistent logical timeline, it is imperative that these messages are processed in the order they are logically meant to occur. The PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG must logically precede the LTC message because they pertain to actions or the lack thereof before the federate declares completion up to a specific point in logical time. This ordering ensures that the simulation's state progresses in a manner that is consistent with the established rules of logical time, preventing any potential inconsistencies or violations of the simulation's temporal logic.

⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then progress to larger sub-formulas constructed from them.

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $(e_1$ is (Receiving NET)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves receiving a NET message.
   - $Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $(Tag e_1) ≤ (Tag e_2)$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $(e_2$ is (Receiving LTC)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves receiving an LTC message.
   - $(Tag e_2) ≠ 0$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_2$ is not equal to zero.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - $((e_1$ is (Receiving NET)) ∧ (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) ≤ (Tag e_2)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ receives a NET message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as that of $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2.
   - $((e_2$ is (Receiving LTC)) ∧ ((Tag e_2) ≠ 0))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ receives an LTC message and the logical tag of $e_2$ is not zero.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - $(((e_1$ is (Receiving NET)) ∧ (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∧ ((Tag e_1) ≤ (Tag e_2))) ∧ ((e_2$ is (Receiving LTC)) ∧ ((Tag e_2) ≠ 0)))$: This sub-formula is true when the combined conditions of the two larger sub-formulas are met simultaneously.

Therefore, the breakdown of the antecedent into its sub-formulas helps us understand the specific conditions under which each sub-formula is true, leading to a comprehensive analysis of when the entire antecedent is true.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 4

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a NET message from a federate, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, with the logical tag of $e_1$ being less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving an LTC message with a non-zero logical tag, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. This formula ensures that when a NET message is received by the RTI from a federate, followed by the RTI receiving an LTC message with a non-zero logical tag, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct progression of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 3 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the logical time progression and message processing rules within a federated simulation system. Specifically, a NET (Next Event Tag) message sent by a federate to the RTI indicates the time of the next scheduled event at that federate, establishing a future point in logical time where an event is expected to occur. An LTC (Logical Tag Complete) message, on the other hand, signifies that the federate has completed all processing up to a certain logical tag. For the system to maintain consistency and ensure that events are processed in the correct logical order, any NET message indicating a future event must logically precede the receipt of an LTC message indicating completion up to a specific tag. This ordering ensures that the RTI and federates operate under a coherent understanding of the simulation's temporal progression, preventing any potential logical time violations or inconsistencies in the simulation's state.

⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas, we will analyze each atomic sub-formula and then combine them to understand when the larger sub-formulas are true.

1. Atomic Sub-Formulas:

   - $e_1$ is receiving an LTC message: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.
   - The federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2.
   - The logical tag of $e_1$ plus the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the sum of the logical tag of event $e_1$ and the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is receiving a PORT_ABS message or $e_2$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG message: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS message or a TAGGED_MSG message.

2. Larger Sub-Formulas:

   - The conjunction of the first three atomic sub-formulas: This sub-formula is true when all three atomic sub-formulas are true simultaneously.
   - The disjunction of the last atomic sub-formula with the conjunction of the first three atomic sub-formulas: This sub-formula is true when either the last atomic sub-formula is true or when all three of the first atomic sub-formulas are true.

3. Implication:
   - The implication of the larger sub-formula with the conclusion $e_1 ≺ e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the larger sub-formula holds and implies that event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas, we can understand the conditions under which each sub-formula is true and how they combine to determine the truth of the overall implication.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 5

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving an LTC message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, with the logical tag of $e_1$ plus the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ being less than the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving either a PORT_ABS message or a TAGGED_MSG message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula ensures that when the RTI receives an LTC message from a federate followed by receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 3 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct based on the logical time progression and the handling of messages within a federated simulation system. The LTC (Logical Tag Complete) message indicates that a federate has completed all its activities up to a certain logical tag, effectively marking a point in logical time. The addition of the largest delay of any outgoing connection from this federate to the logical tag of the LTC message accounts for the maximum time it would take for any signal sent by this federate to reach another federate. Therefore, any subsequent PORT_ABS (indicating the absence of a signal at a specific tag) or TAGGED_MSG (indicating the presence of a signal at a specific tag) message received by the RTI, which pertains to events occurring after this adjusted logical tag, must logically follow the LTC message. This ordering ensures that the simulation's state progresses consistently, with the RTI receiving messages in a sequence that respects the logical timeline and the potential delays in federate-to-federate communication, thereby maintaining the integrity of the simulation's logical time progression and preventing inconsistencies.

   - $e_1$ is the first event satisfying $(((e_1$ is (Sending TAG)) ∨ ((e_1$ is (Sending PTAG)))$: This sub-formula is true when $e_1$ is the first event in the RTI that involves sending either a TAG or a PTAG message.
   - $Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $(Tag e_1) + (largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of e_1) ≥ (Tag e_2)$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ plus the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ is greater than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2$.
   - $e_2$ is (Receiving PORT_ABS) ∨ $e_2$ is (Receiving TAGGED_MSG): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves receiving either a PORT_ABS or a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - $¬((Fed e_2) has no upstream with delay ≤ (Tag e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_2$ has at least one upstream connection with a delay less than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2$.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - $(((e_1$ is the first event satisfying $(((e_1$ is (Sending TAG)) ∨ ((e_1$ is (Sending PTAG)))) ∧ $Federate($e_1$) = $Federate($e_2$) ∧ $(Tag $e_1$) + (largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$) ≥ (Tag $e_2$))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ is the first event in the RTI that involves sending a TAG or PTAG message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ plus the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ is greater than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2$.
   - $((((e_2$ is (Receiving PORT_ABS)) ∨ $(e_2$ is (Receiving TAGGED_MSG))) ∧ $¬((Fed $e_2$) has no upstream with delay ≤ (Tag $e_2$))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message, and the federate associated with $e_2$ has at least one upstream connection with a delay less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2$.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - The entire antecedent of the implication: This sub-formula is true when the conjunction of the two larger sub-formulas described above is satisfied, indicating that the conditions involving the sending and receiving of messages, federate associations, and logical tag comparisons are met for events $e_1$ and $e_2$ in the RTI.

By breaking down the antecedent into its constituent sub-formulas, we can understand the specific conditions under which each part is true and how they collectively contribute to the overall truth of the antecedent.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 6

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI is the first event where the RTI sends a TAG or PTAG message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ plus the largest delay of a connection going out of the federate of $e_1$ is greater than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message, and the federate associated with $e_2$ has at least one upstream connection with a delay less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. This formula ensures that when specific message exchanges and logical tag comparisons occur between the RTI and federates, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the principles of logical time progression and the causality constraints within a federated simulation system. When the RTI sends a TAG (Tag Advance Grant) or PTAG (Provisional Tag Advance Grant) message to a federate, it authorizes the federate to advance to or perform actions at a new logical time, taking into account the largest delay of any outgoing connection from that federate. This ensures that any actions taken by the federate, including sending PORT_ABS (indicating the absence of a signal) or TAGGED_MSG (indicating the presence of a signal), respect the logical time constraints and the potential delays in communication to downstream federates. The requirement that the RTI receives a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message after it has sent a TAG or PTAG message, especially when considering the delays on upstream connections, ensures that the federate's actions are consistent with the logical timeline and causality, preventing any actions or signals from being acknowledged out of order. This ordering is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the simulation's logical time progression and ensuring that all federates operate within the established temporal and causal constraints.

## Formula 7

Formula 7 states:

```
(((((e1 is (Sending PTAG))) ∨ ((e1 is (Sending TAG))))
    ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2))
    ∧ ((Tag e1) < (Tag e2)))
  ∧ (((e2 is (Sending PTAG))) ∨ ((e2 is (Sending TAG)))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then progress to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is sending PTAG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message.
   - $e_1$ is sending TAG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a Tag Advance Grant (TAG) message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when events $e_1$ and $e_2$ occur in the same federate.
   - Tag $e_1$ < Tag $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of event $e_2.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - $((e_1$ is sending PTAG) ∨ ($e_1$ is sending TAG)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending either a PTAG or TAG message.
   - $(((e_1$ is sending PTAG) ∨ ($e_1$ is sending TAG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ < Tag $e_2$)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions of sending either a PTAG or TAG message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, and having a lower logical tag than event $e_2$.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - $(((e_1$ is sending PTAG) ∨ ($e_1$ is sending TAG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ < Tag $e_2$)) ∧ (((e_2$ is sending PTAG) ∨ ($e_2$ is sending TAG))): This largest sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions mentioned above, and event $e_2$ involves the RTI sending either a PTAG or TAG message.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas and understanding when each sub-formula is true, we can analyze the conditions under which the entire antecedent holds true, leading to the implication that $e_1$ must occur before $e_2.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 7

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a Tag Advance Grant (TAG) or Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message, occurring in the same federate as event $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI also involves the RTI sending a PTAG or TAG message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula ensures that when the RTI sends a TAG or PTAG message in a federate, followed by another TAG or PTAG message in the same federate with a higher logical tag, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it adheres to the fundamental principles of logical time progression within a federated simulation system. The RTI's role is to coordinate the advancement of logical time across federates to ensure that all federates proceed through logical time in a consistent and orderly manner. When the RTI sends a Tag Advance Grant (TAG) or Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message to a federate, it signals permission for the federate to advance to a new logical time or to perform actions up to a specified logical time. The requirement that a TAG or PTAG message with a lower logical tag must precede one with a higher logical tag in physical time is essential for maintaining the sequential progression of logical time. This sequence ensures that federates do not act on future logical times before completing actions at present or past logical times, thereby preserving the causality and integrity of the simulation's logical timeline.

⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas, we will analyze each atomic sub-formula and then combine them to understand when the larger sub-formulas are true:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is sending a PTAG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is sending a TAG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TAG message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - ((e_1 is (Sending PTAG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI is sending a PTAG, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2.
   - (e_2 is (Sending TAG)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI is sending a TAG message.

3. Implication:
   - (((e_1 is (Sending PTAG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)) ∧ (e_2 is (Sending TAG))): This sub-formula represents the antecedent of the implication and is true when event $e_1$ sends a PTAG, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ sends a TAG message.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas, we can understand the conditions under which each sub-formula is true and how they collectively contribute to the truth of the larger sub-formulas and the overall implication.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 8

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message to a federate, where the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a Tag Advance Grant (TAG) message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In simpler terms, this formula ensures that when the RTI sends a PTAG message to a federate followed by sending a TAG message to the same federate with a higher or equal logical tag, the PTAG message must precede the TAG message in the sequence of events to maintain the correct temporal order within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the operational rules governing logical time advancement in federated simulations. The Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message allows a federate to proceed up to but not including a specified logical time, serving as a preliminary step before full advancement is granted. The Tag Advance Grant (TAG) message, on the other hand, authorizes the federate to proceed to and include the specified logical time. The logical sequencing of PTAG before TAG for the same or increasing logical tags ensures that federates move through logical time in a controlled and orderly manner, preventing any premature progression to future logical times. This ordering respects the causality and consistency required in the simulation's logical timeline, where provisional permissions must logically precede definitive permissions for the same or subsequent logical times.

          ∧ ((Tag e1) ≥ (Tag e2))))))
  ∧ (((e2 is (Sending TAG))) ∧ ((Tag e2) ≠ 0)))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas, we will start by analyzing the atomic sub-formulas and then build up to the larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is the first event in a given federate satisfying:
     - $e_1$ is receiving an LTC message.
     - The federate of $e_1$ is upstream of the federate of $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection.
     - The logical tag of $e_1$ is greater than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2.
   - $e_1$ is sending a TAG message, receiving a NET message, or sending a STOP_GRN message.
   - The federate of $e_1$ is upstream of the federate of $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection.
   - The logical tag of $e_1$ is greater than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is sending a TAG message, and the logical tag of $e_2$ is not equal to 0.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - The first event in a given federate satisfying the conditions for $e_1$ is true when $e_1$ satisfies the specified criteria for receiving an LTC message, being upstream of $e_2$ with a zero-delay connection, and having a logical tag greater than or equal to that of $e_2.
   - The second part of the antecedent is true when $e_1$ is sending a TAG message, receiving a NET message, or sending a STOP_GRN message, and the conditions related to the federates and logical tags are met.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - The entire antecedent is true when the first event in a given federate satisfying the conditions for $e_1$ leads to the conditions specified for $e_2, where $e_2$ is sending a TAG message with a non-zero logical tag.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas, we can understand the specific criteria that need to be met for each event $e_1$ and $e_2 to satisfy the overall implication. This analysis ensures a clear understanding of when each sub-formula is true and how they collectively contribute to the truth of the entire antecedent.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 9

The formula states that if the first event $e_1$ in a given federate satisfies specific conditions related to receiving an LTC message, being upstream of another federate via a zero-delay connection, and having a logical tag greater than or equal to that of a subsequent event $e_2, or if $e_1$ involves sending a TAG, receiving a NET, or sending a STOP_GRN message while meeting the same upstream and logical tag criteria, and $e_2$ is sending a TAG message with a non-zero logical tag, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2 in physical time. This formula ensures that the specified conditions related to message exchanges, logical tags, and federate relationships are met to establish the correct temporal order between events $e_1$ and $e_2 within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the principles of logical time progression and causality within a federated simulation system. The Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message indicates that a federate has completed all actions up to a certain logical time, establishing a clear point in the logical timeline. When a federate is upstream of another with a zero-delay connection, it implies that any action or message it sends can immediately affect the downstream federate. Therefore, before the RTI can send a Tag Advance Grant (TAG) to any federate, ensuring that the federate can proceed to a new logical time, it must first account for all preceding events (such as receiving LTCs, processing NET messages, or handling STOP_GRN messages) that could influence the logical state up to that point. This ordering respects the causality and dependency between federate actions, ensuring that no federate advances to a new logical time without first resolving all dependencies and actions that could affect or be affected by that advancement, thus maintaining the integrity and consistency of the simulation's logical timeline.

1. Atomic Sub-Formulas:

   - $((e_1$ is (Sending PTAG))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message.
   - $((Federate$ of $e_1$ is upstream of federate of $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection)$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$ with a zero-delay connection.
   - $((Tag$ $e_1) = (Tag$ $e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is equal to the logical tag of event $e_2$.
   - $((e_1$ is (Receiving NET))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a NET message.
   - $((e_1$ is (Sending STOP_GRN))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a STOP_GRN message.
   - $((Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $((Federate$ of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$.

2. Larger Sub-Formulas:

   - $(((e_1$ is the first event satisfying $((e_1$ is (Sending PTAG)) ∧ ((Federate$ of $e_1$ is upstream of federate of $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection)) ∧ ((Tag$ $e_1) = (Tag$ $e_2))))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ is the first event where the RTI sends a PTAG message to a federate that is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection, and the logical tags of $e_1$ and $e_2$ are equal.
   - $((((e_1$ is (Receiving NET)) ∨ $((e_1$ is (Sending STOP_GRN))) ∧ $((Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)) ∨ $((Federate$ of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2))) ∧ $((Tag$ $e_1) = (Tag$ $e_2)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a NET message or sending a STOP_GRN message, and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$ or is directly upstream of the federate associated with $e_2$, with equal logical tags.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas, we can understand the conditions under which each part is true and how they collectively contribute to the overall implication.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 10

The formula specifies that if event $e_1$ in the RTI satisfies certain conditions involving the sending of a Provisional Tag Advance Grant (PTAG) message to a federate that is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$ via a zero-delay connection, and both events have the same logical tag, or if event $e_1$ involves the RTI receiving a NET message or sending a STOP_GRN message to a federate that is the same as or directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$ with the same logical tag, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2 in physical time. This formula outlines specific scenarios where the RTI's actions, based on message exchanges and federate relationships, dictate the temporal order of events to ensure logical consistency and proper progression within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the fundamental principles of logical time management and causality within federated simulation systems. The RTI coordinates the progression of logical time across federates to ensure that all actions and message exchanges adhere to the established logical timeline. When a PTAG message is sent, it provisionally allows a federate to advance to a specified logical time, but not beyond, indicating that further confirmation (such as a TAG message) is required for full advancement. The NET message indicates the next scheduled event for a federate, and the STOP_GRN message is used to manage the orderly shutdown of the simulation. The requirement that these messages, especially when involving federates with direct, zero-delay connections, be processed in a specific order ensures that all dependencies and potential impacts are accounted for before any federate advances in logical time. This preserves the causality and consistency of the simulation, preventing any actions from being taken based on incomplete or out-of-order information, thereby maintaining the integrity of the simulation's logical timeline.

        ∧ ((Tag e1) = (Tag e2)))))
  ∧ ((e2 is (Sending PORT_ABS))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then progress to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is (Receiving PORT_ABS): This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves receiving a PORT_ABS message.
   - Federate of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2: This atomic sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2.
   - Tag $e_1 = Tag $e_2: This atomic sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is (Sending PORT_ABS): This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves sending a PORT_ABS message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - Sub-formula 1: ((e_1 is (Receiving PORT_ABS)) ∧ (Federate of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2) ∧ (Tag $e_1 = Tag $e_2)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies all three conditions - receiving a PORT_ABS message, being directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2, and having the same logical tag as event $e_2.
   - Sub-formula 2: (Sub-formula 1) ∧ ($e_2$ is (Sending PORT_ABS)): This sub-formula is true when Sub-formula 1 is true, and event $e_2$ involves sending a PORT_ABS message.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - Antecedent: Sub-formula 2: This largest sub-formula is true when Sub-formula 2 is true, meaning that event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions specified in Sub-formula 1 and event $e_2$ involves sending a PORT_ABS message.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas and analyzing when each sub-formula is true, we can understand the conditions under which the antecedent as a whole is true, leading to the implication $e_1 ≺ e_2$.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 11

The formula states that if the first event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS message from a federate that is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$, and both events have the same logical tag, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a PORT_ABS message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula ensures that when the RTI receives a PORT_ABS message from an upstream federate with the same logical tag as a subsequent event where the RTI sends a PORT_ABS message, the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it adheres to the logical time progression and message handling protocols within a federated simulation system. The PORT_ABS message indicates the absence of a signal at a specific logical time from an upstream federate to a downstream federate. When the RTI receives a PORT_ABS message from an upstream federate, it signifies that the upstream federate has determined there will be no signal sent at that logical time. Before the RTI can relay this information downstream via sending a PORT_ABS message to the affected downstream federate, it must first receive the message from the upstream federate. This sequence ensures that the absence of a signal is acknowledged upstream before it is communicated downstream, maintaining the integrity of the logical timeline and ensuring that federates act on accurate and timely information regarding the presence or absence of signals. This ordering is crucial for preventing logical inconsistencies and ensuring that the simulation's state progresses in a manner that is consistent with the established rules of logical time and causality.

```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then progress to larger sub-formulas constructed from these atomic components.

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - Federate of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2$: This atomic sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2.
   - Tag of $e_1$ is equal to the tag of $e_2$: This atomic sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is sending a TAGGED_MSG: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TAGGED_MSG message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - Sub-formula 1: $((e_1$ is the first event satisfying (λ $e_1 . ((e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ is the first event in the RTI that involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - Sub-formula 2: $((Federate$ of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2.
   - Sub-formula 3: $((Tag$ of $e_1) = (Tag$ of $e_2))$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.

3. Largest Sub-formula:
   - Sub-formula 4: $(((e_1$ is the first event satisfying (λ $e_1 . ((e_1$ is receiving TAGGED_MSG))) ∧ ((Federate$ of $e_1$ is directly upstream of federate of $e_2)) ∧ ((Tag$ of $e_1) = (Tag$ of $e_2))))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ satisfies all the conditions of being the first event to receive a TAGGED_MSG, having a federate directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2, and having the same logical tag as event $e_2.

By breaking down the antecedent of the implication into these sub-formulas and analyzing when each is true, we can understand the conditions under which the entire antecedent is true, leading to the implication being satisfied.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 12

The formula states that if the first event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message from a federate that is directly upstream of the federate associated with event $e_2$, and both events have the same logical tag, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TAGGED_MSG message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula captures a scenario where the RTI receives a message from an upstream federate and subsequently sends a message to a downstream federate with the same logical tag, ensuring that the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the fundamental principles of logical time management and message flow within a federated simulation system. The TAGGED_MSG message represents a signal being sent from one federate to another, with the RTI acting as the intermediary to ensure proper timing and sequencing. When the RTI receives a TAGGED_MSG from an upstream federate, it indicates that a signal is being sent at a specific logical time. Before the RTI can forward this signal to the downstream federate, it must first receive it from the upstream federate. This sequence ensures that signals are propagated in the correct order, respecting the logical time progression and maintaining the causality and consistency of the simulation. The requirement that the RTI receives the message before sending it on ensures that downstream federates only act on signals after they have been properly processed by the RTI, thus preserving the integrity of the simulation's logical timeline and preventing any potential temporal inconsistencies.

Formula 13 states:

    ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2))
    ∧ ((Tag e1) ≤ (Tag e2)))
  ∧ (((e2 is (Receiving LTC)))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start with the atomic sub-formulas and then build up to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is receiving a PORT_ABS: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS message.
   - $e_1$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$: This sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of event $e_2.
   - $e_2$ is receiving an LTC: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving an LTC message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - (((($e_1$ is receiving a PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves receiving either a PORT_ABS or a TAGGED_MSG message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2.
   - ((($e_1$ is receiving a PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)) ∧ ($e_2$ is receiving an LTC): This sub-formula is true when the previous sub-formula is true and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves receiving an LTC message.

3. Final Sub-formula:
   - (((($e_1$ is receiving a PORT_ABS) ∨ ($e_1$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ (Tag $e_1$ ≤ Tag $e_2$)) ∧ ($e_2$ is receiving an LTC)) ⇒ ($e_1 ≺ $e_2): This is the complete antecedent of the implication, and it is true when the previous sub-formula is true, indicating that if event $e_1$ satisfies the conditions outlined and event $e_2$ involves receiving an LTC message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 13

The formula specifies that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG message from a federate, where the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2, and the logical tag of $e_1$ is less than or equal to the logical tag of $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving an LTC message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula captures a scenario where the RTI receives a message from a federate and subsequently receives an LTC message, ensuring that the order of these events is maintained to prevent inconsistencies and ensure the correct temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it adheres to the logical time progression and message processing protocols within a federated simulation system. The PORT_ABS and TAGGED_MSG messages indicate, respectively, the absence or presence of a signal being sent at a specific logical time from one federate to another. The Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message signifies that a federate has completed all its activities up to a certain logical tag. For the simulation to maintain consistency and causality, any message indicating activity or the lack thereof (PORT_ABS or TAGGED_MSG) at a certain logical time must be processed before acknowledging the completion of all activities up to that logical time (LTC). This ensures that the RTI processes events in a sequence that respects the logical timeline, allowing federates to act on accurate and timely information, thereby preserving the integrity of the simulation's logical progression and preventing temporal inconsistencies.

## Formula 14

Formula 14 states:

```
((((e1 is (Receiving FED_ID))) ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2))) ∧ ((e2 is
(Sending ACK))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas, we start by analyzing the atomic sub-formulas:

1. $e_1$ is receiving a FED_ID message: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a Federate ID (FED_ID) message.
2. $Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)$: This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
3. $e_2$ is sending an ACK message: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending an Acknowledgement (ACK) message.

Next, we consider the larger sub-formulas constructed from the atomic sub-formulas:

- $((e_1$ is receiving a FED_ID$) \land (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2)))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI is receiving a FED_ID message, and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$.
- $(e_2$ is sending an ACK$)$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI is sending an ACK message.

Finally, we analyze the entire antecedent of the implication:

- $(((e_1$ is receiving a FED_ID$) \land (Federate(e_1) = Federate(e_2))) \land (e_2$ is sending an ACK$))$: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI is receiving a FED_ID message from the same federate as event $e_2$, and event $e_2$ is sending an ACK message.

Therefore, the entire antecedent is true when event $e_1$ involves receiving a FED_ID message from the same federate as event $e_2$, and event $e_2$ is sending an ACK message. This analysis provides a detailed breakdown of when each sub-formula is true, leading to the truth of the entire antecedent in the given implication.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 14

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a Federate ID (FED_ID) message and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending an Acknowledgement (ACK) message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In simpler terms, this formula ensures that when the RTI receives a FED_ID message from a federate and subsequently the RTI sends an ACK message to the same federate, the FED_ID reception must precede the ACK transmission in the temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it reflects the fundamental process of federate registration and acknowledgment within a federated simulation system. When a federate sends its Federate ID (FED_ID) to the RTI, it is essentially announcing its presence and requesting to be part of the simulation. The RTI, upon receiving this FED_ID, processes the registration and then sends back an Acknowledgement (ACK) to confirm the federate's successful registration. This sequence—receiving the FED_ID before sending the ACK—is essential for ensuring that the federate is recognized and registered by the RTI before any acknowledgment of participation is communicated. This order of operations is a basic requirement for the initialization and management of federates within the system, ensuring that each federate is properly accounted for before proceeding with the simulation activities.

## Formula 15

Formula 15 states:

```
((((e1 is (Sending ACK))) ∧ (Federate (e1) = Federate (e2)))
  ∧ ((e2 is (Receiving TIMESTAMP))))
⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas and analyze when they are true, we will start by examining the atomic sub-formulas and then progress to larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is sending an ACK: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending an Acknowledgement (ACK) message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $e_2$ is receiving a TIMESTAMP: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - ((e_1 is sending ACK) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$))): This sub-formula is true when both the RTI is sending an ACK message and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$.
   - ((e_2 is receiving TIMESTAMP)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message.

3. Full Antecedent:
   - (((e_1 is sending ACK) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)) ∧ ((e_2 is receiving TIMESTAMP))): This sub-formula is true when the RTI sends an ACK message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the RTI receives a TIMESTAMP message.

Therefore, the full antecedent of the implication is true when the RTI sends an ACK message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and the RTI receives a TIMESTAMP message. This breakdown helps understand the conditions under which the antecedent of the implication holds true.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 15

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending an Acknowledgement (ACK) message to a federate, where the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In essence, this formula specifies that when the RTI sends an ACK message to a federate and subsequently receives a TIMESTAMP message, the order of these events is such that the sending of the ACK message precedes the receipt of the TIMESTAMP message, ensuring a sequential and orderly flow of communication and actions within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the standard procedure for federate registration and initialization within a federated simulation system. Initially, a federate sends its Federate ID (FED_ID) to the RTI to register its presence. Upon successfully processing this registration, the RTI sends an Acknowledgement (ACK) back to the federate. This ACK serves as confirmation that the federate's registration has been recognized. Following this, the federate may send a TIMESTAMP message to the RTI, indicating its agreement on the start time for the simulation or acknowledging the synchronized time. The sequence—where the RTI sends an ACK before receiving a TIMESTAMP message—ensures that the federate is fully registered and acknowledged by the RTI before any simulation time-related communication takes place. This ordering is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the simulation's initialization phase, ensuring that all federates are properly registered and synchronized before proceeding with the simulation activities.

1. Atomic Sub-formulas:

   - $e_1$ is receiving a TIMESTAMP: This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $e_2$ is sending a TIMESTAMP: This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TIMESTAMP message.

2. Larger Sub-formulas:

   - ((e_1 is (Receiving TIMESTAMP))) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI is receiving a TIMESTAMP message and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$.
   - (e_2 is (Sending TIMESTAMP)): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI is sending a TIMESTAMP message.

3. Full Antecedent:
   - (((e_1 is (Receiving TIMESTAMP))) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$))) ∧ ((e_2 is (Sending TIMESTAMP))): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI is receiving a TIMESTAMP message, the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$, and event $e_2$ in the RTI is sending a TIMESTAMP message.

By breaking down the antecedent into its sub-formulas, we can understand the conditions under which each sub-formula is true and how they collectively contribute to the truth of the larger sub-formulas and the full antecedent.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 16

The formula states that if event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message from a federate, where the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2, and event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TIMESTAMP message, then event $e_1$ must occur before event $e_2$ in physical time. In simpler terms, this formula ensures that when the RTI receives a TIMESTAMP message from a federate and subsequently sends a TIMESTAMP message to the same federate, the reception of the TIMESTAMP message precedes the sending of the TIMESTAMP message, maintaining the temporal sequence of events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 4 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it reflects the logical sequence of operations during the initialization phase of a federated simulation system. The TIMESTAMP message, typically used for synchronizing the start time among federates and the RTI, necessitates a specific order of operations. Initially, a federate sends a TIMESTAMP message to the RTI, proposing or acknowledging a simulation start time. The RTI, upon receiving this message, processes it to coordinate the start time across all federates. The RTI may then send a TIMESTAMP message back to the federate(s) as part of this coordination process. This sequence—where the RTI first receives a TIMESTAMP message from a federate and then sends a TIMESTAMP message—ensures that the simulation's timing is mutually agreed upon and synchronized among all participants. This order is crucial for maintaining the integrity and synchronization of the simulation's initialization, ensuring that all federates commence the simulation with a shared understanding of the starting logical time.

⇒ (e1 ≺ e2)
```

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To analyze when each sub-formula is true, let's break down the antecedent of the implication into its atomic and larger sub-formulas:

1. Atomic Sub-Formulas:

   - $e_1$ is sending a TIMESTAMP: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TIMESTAMP message.
   - Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$): This atomic sub-formula is true when the federate associated with event $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with event $e_2$.
   - $e_2$ is receiving a NET: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a NET message.
   - ¬((Tag $e_2$) ≠ 0): This atomic sub-formula is true when the logical tag of event $e_2$ is equal to 0.

2. Larger Sub-Formulas:

   - ((e_1 is (Sending TIMESTAMP)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$))): This sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ involves the RTI sending a TIMESTAMP message and the federate associated with $e_1$ is the same as the federate associated with $e_2$.
   - ((e_2 is (Receiving NET)) ∧ (¬((Tag $e_2$) ≠ 0))): This sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ involves the RTI receiving a NET message and the logical tag of $e_2$ is 0.

3. Full Antecedent:
   - (((e_1 is (Sending TIMESTAMP)) ∧ (Federate($e_1$) = Federate($e_2$))) ∧ ((e_2 is (Receiving NET)) ∧ (¬((Tag $e_2$) ≠ 0)))): This larger sub-formula is true when both the sub-formulas within it are true, i.e., when event $e_1$ sends a TIMESTAMP message to the same federate as event $e_2$, and event $e_2$ receives a NET message with a logical tag of 0.

By breaking down the antecedent into its atomic and larger sub-formulas, we can understand the conditions under which each sub-formula is true and how they collectively contribute to the truth of the full antecedent.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 17

The formula states that if the RTI sends a TIMESTAMP message to a federate, and the federate associated with that event is the same as the federate receiving a NET message with a logical tag of 0, then the sending of the TIMESTAMP message by the RTI must precede the receipt of the NET message by the federate in real-world time. In essence, this formula ensures that the synchronization message (TIMESTAMP) sent by the RTI to a federate occurs before the federate receives a NET message with a logical tag of 0, establishing a temporal relationship between these two events within the federated system.

_(This explanation was generated in 5 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it aligns with the operational protocols for initializing and synchronizing federates within a federated simulation system. The TIMESTAMP message is crucial for establishing a common start time across all federates, ensuring that the simulation begins in a coordinated manner. The NET (Next Event Tag) message, especially with a logical tag of 0, signifies the scheduling of the very first event within a federate as the simulation starts. For the simulation to operate cohesively, it is essential that all federates are synchronized to the same start time before any events are processed. Therefore, the RTI sending a TIMESTAMP message to a federate must logically precede the federate's processing of a NET message with a logical tag of 0. This sequence ensures that the federate is properly synchronized with the rest of the simulation environment before it begins processing or scheduling events, maintaining the integrity and coherence of the simulation's temporal framework.

### In-depth syntactic explanation

To break down the antecedent of the implication into its sub-formulas, we will start by analyzing when each atomic sub-formula is true:

1. $e_1$ is receiving a TIMESTAMP message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_1$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TIMESTAMP message from a federate.

2. $e_2$ is receiving an LTC message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a Logical Tag Complete (LTC) message.

3. $e_2$ is receiving a PORT_ABS message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a PORT_ABS message.

4. $e_2$ is receiving a TAGGED_MSG message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a TAGGED_MSG message.

5. $e_2$ is sending a TAG message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI sending a TAG message.

11. $e_2$ is receiving a STOP_REQ message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a STOP_REQ message.

12. $e_2$ is receiving a STOP_REQ_REP message: This atomic sub-formula is true when event $e_2$ in the RTI involves the RTI receiving a STOP_REQ_REP message.

Next, we will analyze the larger sub-formulas constructed from these atomic sub-formulas and determine when they are true.

### Summary of the meaning of formula 18

The formula states that if the RTI receives a TIMESTAMP message from a federate and subsequently encounters an event where it receives an LTC, PORT_ABS, TAGGED_MSG, or sends a TAG, PTAG, PORT_ABS, TAGGED_MSG, STOP_GRN, STOP_REQ, or receives STOP_REQ, STOP_REQ_REP message, then the initial event of receiving the TIMESTAMP message must occur before the latter event. In essence, this formula ensures that the RTI processing of a TIMESTAMP message from a federate precedes any subsequent event involving the RTI's interaction with LTC, PORT_ABS, TAGGED_MSG, TAG, PTAG, STOP_GRN, STOP_REQ, or STOP_REQ_REP messages. This logical relationship establishes a sequence of events within the federated system, where the synchronization of time precedes further actions or acknowledgments by the RTI.

_(This explanation was generated in 5 seconds.)_

### High-level justification

This guarantee is expected to be correct because it adheres to the foundational principles of time management and event sequencing within a federated simulation system. The TIMESTAMP message is critical for establishing a synchronized start time across all federates, ensuring that the simulation operates coherently from a common temporal baseline. Following this synchronization, the RTI's receipt of an LTC (Logical Time Complete), PORT_ABS (Port Absent), TAGGED_MSG (Tagged Message), or its sending of TAG (Tag Advance Grant), PTAG (Provisional Tag Advance Grant), STOP_GRN (Stop Granted), STOP_REQ (Stop Request), or interaction with STOP_REQ_REP (Stop Request Reply) messages, represents subsequent steps in the simulation's progression. These steps involve the processing of events, managing logical time advancement, and handling federate interactions. The initial receipt of the TIMESTAMP message logically precedes these actions to ensure that all federates and the RTI are aligned in time before any simulation events are processed or any logical time advancements are made. This sequence maintains the integrity of the simulation's logical timeline, ensuring that events unfold in a manner that is consistent with the established temporal framework and the causality of interactions.
